# Color Names 

These are mappings from evocative english phrases ("apple", "bluish green", "baby poop") to RGB values for colors they represent.

See Aubrey Jaffer's [Color Dictionaries](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Color/Dictionaries) for highly-detailed description of the dictionaries, with descriptions of their tradeoffs.

Project idea: find the voronoi lattice of the color names (for each color name, the 3-d polygon within which all points are closer to that color name than any other) and make a color picker that grids those polygons onto the screen.

## Color Names: NBS/ISCC (Aubrey Jaffer)

A curated version of the NBS/ISCC "Dictionary of Color Names" -- A compendium of colors and their names from academic, government, textile, dye, paint, horticultural, and manufacturing sources.

These names are good for surface colors; note that among other things this implies white and black are #f2f3f4/#222222, (not #ffffff and #000000).

* **Kenneth L. Kelly and Deanne B. Judd** "Color: Universal Language and Dictionary of Names", National Bureau of Standards, Spec. Publ. 440, Dec. 1976, 189 pages.
* **David A. Mundie**: http://www.anthus.com/Colors/Cent.html converted the NBS Centroid colors from Munsell to CIE XYZ, then converted to Mac QuickDraw RGB.
* **John Foster**: John Foster of the Texas Precancel Club greatly improved the NBS centroids
* **Gretag-Macbeth**: Reconverted supplied Munsell values via Munsell software downloaded from www.gretagmacbeth.com <http://www.gretagmacbeth.com> directly to RGB.  
* **Aubrey Jaffer** curated it into the list seen here. 

Notes:

* Transcription errors from NBS Spec. Publ. 440 have been fixed.
* The duplicated colors have been separated.
* White is now white and the pink bias is eliminated.
* "Pink" and "brown" are used instead of the more logical "pale red" and "dark orange".
* Some of these don't even look right, because some of the bright colors are on the dark fringes with less chroma and are not centered and high up on the hue curves.  
* Many of the original Munsell values (noted) are outside the RGB gamut, and have been adjusted to the closest brightest RGB value by changing chroma until 0 or 255 is reached in one out of bounds RGB component.
* Guesses were made in a few cases (noted) where the color was still illogical compared to the name.

## Color Names: XKCD Color Survey

Some boring notes on data handling:

For the sake of anyone who might use this, I also snapped three of the 954 colors to corners of the color space when they were hovering almost on the corners and the data was fuzzy; e.g. I moved black from #000102 to #000000. But mostly I left it alone.

There were about 40,000 women and 100,000 men in the main data set used for this, which could in principle skew things (if men are overrepresented and disagree with women over what a particular color is) but when I reran the analysis with the genders separated the results were roughly the same. 

There are a couple of 'again's and 'darker's which are survey artifacts (e.g. 'green again' or 'darker blue') that I missed while cleaning up the table. I can't regen it now, but I've deleted them from rgb.txt.

The algorithm used the hillclimbing setup when there were enough data points available, but for the lowest ones on this list, it used a simple geometric mean of the color values. 

I've normalized the 'gray' spelling to 'grey' since that was more popular among my users, and when colors varied by punctuation (blue-green vs blue green) I used the most popular version. I left "darkgreen" separate from "dark green", because it wasn't always obvious to me that it was a different color word. I also pulled most of the spam and a few other non-color entries. Following Crayola's lead, I also decided to leave out 'skin' and its derivatives from the final list, since that seems to be a whole can of worms; judging from the RGB values, though, my readership skews white and nerdy.

The following names were close enough to others (eg. green blue `06b48b` vs green/blue `01c08d` vs greenblue `23c48b`) that they were culled as duplicates:
