## Encodings
All SQL dumps are theoretically encoded in UTF-8, but the Wikipedia dumps contain malformed characters. You might see a 'Invalid UTF-8 byte sequence' error when running a Wukong because of this.

To fix this, use `guard_encoding` in `MungingUtils` to filter out malformed characters before attempting to process them. `guard_encoding` replaces all invalid characters with 'ï¿½'.

If you need to ensure that all characters are valid UTF-8 when piping things around on the command line, then pipe your stream through `char_filter.rb`.

If you need an invalid UTF-8 character, pretty much any single-byte character above \x79 will do. e.g:

    > char = "\x80"
    => "\x80"
    > char.encoding.name
    => "UTF-8"
    > char.valid_encoding?
    => false

[James Gray's blog](http://blog.grayproductions.net/articles/understanding_m17n) is really valuable for further reading on this.

## Dates
Date information should be formatted as follows:

    +----------+--------+--------------------------+-------------+
    | int      | int    | long or float            | int         |
    +----------+--------+--------------------------+-------------+
    | YYYYMMDD | HHMMSS | Seconds since Unix epoch | Day of week |
    +----------+--------+--------------------------+-------------+

Should always be in the UTC time zone.

Hours go from 0 to 23

Months go from 01 to 12

Day of week goes from 0 to 6 (Sunday to Saturday)
