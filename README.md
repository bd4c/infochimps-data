# Infochimps Data: Useful datasets from all over

## Additional datasets

To keep the git repo from bloating too much, some datasets are submoduled and not versioned directly. To include them, clone this repo with the `--recursive` flag, eg

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/infochimps-data/infochimps-data

Note: this is many gigabytes of data.
