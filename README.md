# Example Data for Wukong and friends

This repo holds example datasets for testing Wukong -- and in many cases useful beyond that.

## Additional datasets

To keep the git repo from bloating too much, some datasets are put up as downloads and not versioned directly.

* `geo/wikigrounder_toponyms` (5 MB/23 MB) -- grounded place names with rough categories (county, province, etc) [download](https://github.com/downloads/infochimps-labs/wukong-example-data/wikigrounder_toponyms.tar.bz2)
